December 9, 2011

It took me about 2.5 hours to review and rejuvenate the class materials for this year.  Most of the time was spend on re-thinking where to locate files, and then fixing all the instructions, to reflect changes from last year (use of BlackBoard deprecated, and didn't have access as of today).  I also experienced some difficulty with the local cvs server.  This reminds me that I should test the grace cvs server before Monday.

final notes on BISI548b class

synopsis.  I volunteered to teach a "best practices" session in a course on computing for biologists.  I prepared a slide presentation and detailed lessons, conducted a 2-hour class, posted an assignment, and checked the assignment.  The materials could be used again for a similar class, or adapted for a longer or shorter class.  

resources
* files in camel12:~/Education/Teaching/BISI648b
** html lesson guide-sheets (Lessons)
** assignment (Assignment) 
** powerpoint presentation 
** PDFs of some interesting references 
** other stuff 
* module "best_practices" in camel5.umbi.umd.edu:/usr/local/cvsroot is a subset of what is in the directory
* ELMS web site largely overlaps with what is local.  Only exceptions are the links to tutorials and help documents.  

goals and approach
I wanted to convey some of the practices that would be useful to programmers at a beginning level.  I wanted the course to have a strong practical component.  The materials are designed for 30 minutes of lecture (20 min plus questions), followed by 90 min of practical exercises.  

outcome 
The actual course seemed to work well.  the time came out right.  One student provided feedback to the effect that it was valuable.  I did not get feedback from the others.  There was no negative feedback.  

time
As per usual, I spent more time on this than expected.  It's shocking, really.  I spent about 30 hours total.  The details: I started well, spending about an hour in some planning back in October and early November.  But I didn't really get deeply into it until Nov 22, when I spent 6 hours figuring out how to build a lesson on CVS.  Week of Dec 6 I spent 11.25 hours in preparation of slides and lessons, plus 4 hours presenting the course (includes travel).  Then I spent 6 hours on checking and followup.  The next week, I spent 2.5 hours finishing the checking, updating everything one last time, and turning in grades. I spent inordinate amounts of time tracking down odd behavior in one student's script, and fixing little glitches in lessons and uploading to ELMS in what seemed like an endless process.  

additional notes
* I spent some time sorting out my ideas about what practices were most important.  
* I did not get much help from other resources.  However, after the session, Steve Mount provided some interesting references which I downloaded and added to the archive.  These tended to confirm my decisions.
